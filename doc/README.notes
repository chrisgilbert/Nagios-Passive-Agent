Post Release Notes and Amendments
---------------------------------

Have a look here for information on how to resolve common issues.


Windows Errors on 2008 Server 64-bit
-------------------------------------
You may receive the error below in the npa.log on windows:

ERROR [OSGatherer] runCmdWin(): Error occurred: Invalid XSL format (or) file name.

This is a windows bug caused by the wmic command being unable to find XSL files.  You can resolve the issue by running the following commands:

32-bit:

copy %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\en-US\*.xsl %SYSTEMROOT%\system32

64-bit:

copy %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\en-US\*.xsl %SYSTEMROOT%\SysWOW64\wbem


Trusted SSL Certs - Importing an SSL certificate:
--------------------------------------------------

If the JRE running NPA does not trust the root certificate authority which generated the certificate, you will receive errors in the logs like the following:

javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: peer not authenticated

This can also occur if you are using a proxy, and the proxy certificate is not trusted.
To avoid this problem, export the certifcate from your browser, by going to the nagios address (or proxy address) manually.  You'll need to export as a DER X.509 (.cer) file.  There are instructions on doing this from Internet Explorer at the following link:

http://www.herongyang.com/Cryptography/Web-Browser-IE-Export-Certificates.html

Next, copy the file to the monitored host, and run a command similar to below:

keytool -import -file /root/proxy_cert.cer -alias haringey-proxy -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/security/cacerts/

Depending on the version of java you have installed, and the keystore location, you'll need to adjust the command.  The keystore which you change should be the 'cacerts' directory inside the jre/security/ directory, under the JAVA_HOME.
