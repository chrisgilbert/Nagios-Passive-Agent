This is the git repository for NPA.  I decided to change to git, to gain some greater flexibility in version control, and also to learn about it.

There are several branches:

||master||main dev branch|
||*_patches||patches on previous stable versions|

To checkout the repo, and modify locally in your own branch, do the following:

{noformat}
git clone https://github.com/chrisgilbert/Nagios-Passive-Agent.git	
git -b my_branch
{noformat}

Please see http://npa.sourceforge.net for further information on the project.

Thanks!
